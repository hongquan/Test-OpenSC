Test-OpenSC
=============
My test script to test OpenSC card driver.
I'm focusing on OpenPGP card.

The test script run opensc-explorer, calls "do_put" many times with different values.

Run the test_*.py script to test.
The testcases.txt file contains test cases litst.

Require Python 2.7 + pexpect module (not sure if Python 2.6 works).
